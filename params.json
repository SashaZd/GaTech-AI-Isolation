The proposed agent would be able to judge the personality type and skill level of the human playing the game and make moves to match this characterization of the player. In doing so, we aim to create a gaming system that is personalized - an important characteristic of an intelligent, interactive system.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
