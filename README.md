GaTech-AI-Isolation
=========
In video games, Game AI is primarily used to simulate human-like intelligence while keeping within the restrictions of the game environment. Game AI has a different approach over traditional AI as the computers abilities are toned down to give human players a feeling of fairness. AI opponents generally sport an increasing level of difficulty, challenging the human player.

In this project we propose the creation of an AI Game Playing agent that could play Isolation, a multiplayer puzzle game executed on a 8x8 grid. The proposed agent would be able to judge the personality type and skill level of the human playing the game and make moves to match this characterization of the player. In doing so, we aim to create a gaming system that is personalized - an important characteristic of an intelligent, interactive system.
